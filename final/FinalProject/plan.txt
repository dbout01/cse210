FINAL PROJECT PLAN

1. Open-ended project
2. I plan on developing a C# program centered around the management of a digital wine cellar.
As C# student, I learned the core principles of programming with classes to create a solution.
the base class is the 'WineCellarManager,' serving as the focal point helping various classes.
These include 'Wine' for individual bottle representation, 'WineCellar' for overall collection
management, 'WineCatalog' for an organized list of options, and 'WineStatistics' for data
analysis. The 'FileHandler' manages file operations, 'UserInterface' ensures a user-friendly
experience, and 'ValidationHelper' maintains data integrity.
