Class: Journal
    Attributes:
        entries: A list that stores objects of the Entry class. This attribute keeps track of the entries in the journal
    Behaviors:
        add_entry(entry: Entry): A method that adds a new entry (object of the Entry class) to the entries list.
        remove_entry(entry: Entry): A method that removes a specified entry (object of the Entry class) from the entries list
        save_to_file(filename: str): A method that saves the journal entries to a file specified by the filename parameter
        load_from_file(filename: str): A method that loads journal entries from a file specified by the filename parameter


Class: PromptGenerator
    Attributes:
        prompts: A list that stores generated prompts as strings. This attribute allows the class to keep track of the prompts it has generated
    Behaviors:
        generate_prompt() -> str: A method that generates and returns a prompt as a string. This method is responsible for generating prompts based on some logic and adding them to the prompts list


Class: Entry
    Attributes:
        date: An attribute of type Date representing the date of the entry
        content: A string attribute representing the content of the entry
    Behaviors:
        edit_content(new_content: str): A method that allows editing the content of the entry. It takes a new content string as a parameter and updates the content attribute
        get_date() -> Date: A method that retrieves and returns the date of the entry
        get_content() -> str: A method that retrieves and returns the content of the entry as a string




DESCRIPTIONS:

    Saving/Loading
        - Saving/Loading functionality is defined through the methods save_to_file(filename: str) and load_from_file(filename: str) in the Journal class
        The save_to_file method saves the journal entries to a specified file, and the load_from_file method loads journal entries from a specified file
        These methods enable the journal entries to be persisted and retrieved as needed


PromptGenerator
        - Prompt generation is defined for this assignment through the PromptGenerator class
          The PromptGenerator class contains the method generate_prompt() -> str, which generates and returns prompts as strings
        The generated prompts are stored in the prompts list attribute of the class


Interaction
    Journal and Entry Interaction:
        The Journal class contains a list of Entry objects, allowing for the addition and removal of entries through the add_entry(entry: Entry) and remove_entry(entry: Entry) methods
        Entries are represented by the Entry class, which has attributes for date and content, along with methods for editing content (edit_content(new_content: str)) and retrieving date and content (get_date() -> Date, get_content() -> str)

    Journal and Saving/Loading Interaction:
        The Journal class interacts with the saving/loading functionality through the save_to_file(filename: str) and load_from_file(filename: str) methods
        These methods allow the journal entries to be saved to and loaded from external files, providing a way to store the journal data

    PromptGenerator Interaction:
        The PromptGenerator class operates independently by generating prompts through the generate_prompt() -> str method
        These prompts are stored in the prompts list within the PromptGenerator class
