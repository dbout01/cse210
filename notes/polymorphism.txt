What is Polymorphism?
    Polymorphism is the ability to take on many forms. In programming, this principle is shown when
    one line of code can have different behavior depending on the context.

    Method Overriding
        To see polymorphism in action with objects and inheritance, you first need to learn about method overriding. Method overriding is the ability of a child class to override, or change the behavior of, a method that it inherited from a parent class. The method name stays the same but the behavior, or the code to run is different.

    Abstract Methods
        Any class that has at least one abstract method. This means that the base abstract class cannot be directly instantiated, you can only create objects from the derived types. You specify abstract methods with the abstract keyword instead of virtual. Then, the class definition must also contain the abstract keyword.
