INHERITANCE
     - Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.
     - Code reuse
        example:

            // a regular class called Person
            public class Person // Person = "Parent Class", "Based", "Derived"
            {
                public string GetName()
                {
                    return "Joseph";
                }
            }

            // a class that inherits from Person
            public class Student : Person // Student = "Child Class", "Super", "Sub"
            {
                public string GetNumber()
                {
                    return "0123456789";
                }
            }
        
        - 'Student' class is a specific type of person & inherits all attributes & methods from 'Person'
        - The syntax for specifying an inheritance relationship is found in the declaration of the child class
        - When defining the name of the class, you use a colon followed by the name of the parent class (shown on line 15)
        - You can use the 'base' keyword to call methods from a parent class in a child Class
        - Limit inheritance levels to the average number of items to 3-4
